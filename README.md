# Car Generator Using JavaScript

## Objective

I developed a simple Car Generator app using JavaScript. It prompts users to select a car brand and provides options. If all options are exhausted, it suggests trying a different brand. The purpose and end goal of this project were to introduce myself to JavaScript and demonstrate basic interactivity and data handling.


### Skills Learned

- JavaScript Basics: Understanding the syntax and foundational concepts of JavaScript, such as variables, functions, and control structures.
- User Input Handling: Implementing and managing user interactions through prompts and responses, ensuring the program can handle various user inputs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
-Conditional Statements: Effectively using if-else statements to create dynamic and responsive application logic based on user choices.

### Tools Used

- JavaScript: The primary programming language used to develop the Car Generator application.
- Replit: An online coding platform used to write, test, and share your JavaScript code.

## Steps

Defined the Problem: I decided to create a program that randomly suggests car models from three brands (BMW, Mercedes, Audi) to engage users.

Planned the Solution: Developed the pseudocode to outline the program's logic, including user prompts and conditional statements.

Set Up Environment: Used Replit to set up the coding environment and began writing the JavaScript code.

Handled User Input: Implemented prompts to ask users if they wanted a car suggestion and which brand they preferred.

Stored Car Models: Used arrays to store car models for each brand.

Implemented Logic: Used if-else statements to select the appropriate car models based on user input.


Iterated Options: Looped through the car models, suggesting one at a time, and asked users if they were interested.


Provided Feedback: Displayed messages based on user responses, suggesting other brands if necessary.

Tested the Program: Ran the code, identified, and fixed any errors or bugs.

Documented the Code: Added comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each part of the code.

Finalized and Shared: Ensured the program ran smoothly and shared the Replit link for others to access and use the application.
